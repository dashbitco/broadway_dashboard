# Broadway Dashboard

[Online documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/broadway_dashboard)

<!-- MDOC !-->

`BroadwayDashboard` is a tool to analyze [`Broadway`](https://hexdocs.pm/broadway)
pipelines. It provides some insights about performance and errors for
your running pipelines.

It works as an additional page for the [`Phoenix LiveDashboard`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_dashboard).

You can inspect pipelines on remote nodes that are not running `BroadwayDashboard` too.
See [Distribution](#distribution) for details.

## Integration with Phoenix Live Dashboard

You can add this page to your Phoenix Live Dashboard by adding as a page in
the `live_dashboard` macro at your router file.

```elixir
live_dashboard "/dashboard",
  additional_pages: [
    broadway: {BroadwayDashboard, pipelines: [MyBroadway]}
  ]
```

The `:pipelines` option accept pipeline names (the `:name` option of your Broadway).
By ommiting the `:pipelines` option, `BroadwayDashboard` will try to autodiscover your pipelines.

```elixir
live_dashboard "/dashboard",
  additional_pages: [
    broadway: BroadwayDashboard
  ]
```

Once configured, you will be able to access the `BroadwayDashboard` at `/dashboard/broadway`.

## Distribution

**Phoenix LiveDashboard** works with distribution out of the box, and it's not different
with **Broadway Dashboard**! You can inspect your pipelines that are running on connected nodes.

You can also inspect pipelines from nodes that are not running the same system of
your dashboard. This is possible because we "copy" the essential parts of this
tool to the remote node when it's not running `BroadwayDashboard`. We stop the tracking
once the node that started it is disconnected.

## Installation

Add the following to your `mix.exs` and run mix `deps.get`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:broadway_dashboard, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

After that, proceed with instructions described in **Integration with Phoenix LiveDashboard** above.

## Acknowledgment

This project is based on [Marlus Saraiva's](https://github.com/msaraiva/) work from
[his presentation at ElixirConf 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPu-P97-cbE).

In that talk he presented a graph showing the work of a Broadway pipeline, which is
essentially the same we display in this project.
Thank you, Marlus! <3
